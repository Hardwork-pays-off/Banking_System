# Banking_System

This code is to create a bank using Java with the following constraints: 

Account holders should maintain a minimum balance of 1000 INR for savings and 5000 INR for their current account. The bank charges penalties and service charges, and deposits interest according to the constraints mentioned below. Create a class that stores customer name, account number and type of account to make them more specific to their requirements. Assume that the minimum balance is the cash available in the account. Solve this problem using inheritance. Write this as a menu-driven program.

1.      Penalty charges – if the minimum balance is not available penalty of 0.5% should be deducted for the balance which is not available. The balance should be verified for each transaction.

2.      Service Charges – for every 3rd withdrawal of cash from the account 2.5% should be deducted.

3.      Interest deposit – for every 3rd deposit and minimum balance in all transactions is maintained, and then 0.9% is deposited in the account.

The final output is stored in the file named "Output".
